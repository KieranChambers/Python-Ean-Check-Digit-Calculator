## Reasoning behind this script

I was using [GS1.org](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) to confirm check digits at work but you can only query one manually and then have to re-enter the input. This is highly inneficient when you want to query multiple at once so I built something that I could query multiple check-digits programmatically.
